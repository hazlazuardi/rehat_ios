<h1>Anxiety: What? Why? How?</h1>
            <p>
                Anxiety can be likened to a smoke alarm system, much like the one in our homes. 
                Just as a smoke alarm is crucial for our safety during a real fire, anxiety serves a protective function when there's genuine danger. 
                However, when a smoke alarm becomes overly sensitive and triggers for minor reasons like burnt toast, it can be irritating. 
                Similarly, when anxiety is constantly activated in non-threatening situations, it becomes not only frightening but also mentally draining. 
                The goal is not to eliminate anxiety entirely, just as we wouldn't remove the smoke alarm, but to adjust it so that it responds appropriately to real threats, 
                bringing anxiety down to a manageable level.

                Our body's fight-flight-freeze response is a primal reaction designed to keep us safe from imminent danger, such as encountering a black bear in the woods. 
                It prompts us to flee, freeze, or fight in response to genuine threats. However, this same response can be activated when situations feel threatening but aren't, 
                as in a job interview. In these cases, you might experience jitteriness, edginess, or discomfort, which can lead to snapping at others (fight), 
                difficulty concentrating (freeze), or a strong urge to avoid the situation (flight). Many individuals end up avoiding situations that trigger anxiety, 
                limiting their experiences. Understanding these reactions and learning to manage anxiety is essential for leading a fulfilling life.
