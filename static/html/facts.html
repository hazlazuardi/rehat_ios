<h1>Panic Attack: Myths and Facts</h1>
<p> Because there is no immediate or apparent external danger in a panic attack, you may
    tend to invent or attribute danger to the intense bodily sensations you’re going through. In
    the absence of any real life-threatening situation, your mind may misinterpret what’s going
    on inside as being life-threatening. Your mind can very quickly go through the following
    process: “If I feel this bad, I must be in some danger. If there is no apparent external danger,
    the danger must be inside of me.” In reality, panic attacks are intense but not physically harmful. 
    Understanding that the bodily reactions are natural and not indicative of danger is crucial in learning to manage panic. </p>
