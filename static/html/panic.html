<h1>Panic Attack:Oh No! What's Going On? </h1>
            <p>
                A panic attack is a sudden and intense episode of extreme anxiety and fear. It can feel incredibly distressing and overwhelming.

                Imagine you're going about your day, perhaps hanging out with friends, studying, or doing everyday activities, when suddenly you're hit by an intense wave of anxiety and fear. 
                It feels like a storm inside your body and mind. 
                Your heart races uncontrollably, often feeling like it's pounding out of your chest. 
                You might struggle to breathe, experiencing shortness of breath or even feeling like you're choking. 
                Your body might shake, and you could become sweaty and flushed.
                At the same time, you might feel an overwhelming sense of dread or doom, as if something really terrible is happening or about to happen. Your thoughts might race, and you might have trouble focusing on anything else. This intense mix of physical and psychological symptoms is what we call a "panic attack." </p>

                Panic attacks can be incredibly distressing because they seem to come out of nowhere and can make you feel like you're losing control. Even though there may not be an immediate danger, your body's "fight or flight" response gets triggered, and it goes into overdrive.
                
                These attacks can be triggered by various things like stress, certain situations, or even just the fear of having another panic attack. They are quite common and can happen to anyone. Sometimes, people who experience panic attacks may worry about having more of them, and this fear can actually make more attacks more likely.
