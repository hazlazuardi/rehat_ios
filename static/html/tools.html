    <h2>Recognize your symptoms</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Recognizing physical symptoms of anxiety</li>
            <li>Recognizing anxious thoughts</li>
            <li>Recognizng anxious behaviours</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Learn to relax</h2>
        <h3>Calm Breathing</h3>
        <p>
            This is a strategy that you can use to help reduce some of the
            physical symptoms experienced during a panic attack. We tend to breathe faster when
            we are anxious, which can make us feel dizzy and lightheaded, which in turn can make
            us even more anxious. Calm breathing involves taking slow, regular breaths through
            your nose. However, it is important to realize that the goal of calm breathing is not to
            stop a panic attack because it’s dangerous, but to make it a little easier to “ride out” the
            feelings.
        </p>
        <h3>Progressive Muscle Relaxation</h3>
        <p>
            Another helpful strategy involves learning to relax your body.
            This technique involves tensing various muscles and then relaxing them, to help lower
            overall tension and stress levels, which can contribute to panic attacks.
        </p>
    
    <h2>Challenge your thoughts</h2>
    <p>
        The next tool involves learning to identify scary thoughts that can trigger and
        fuel physical feelings of panic. First, ask yourself what you are afraid will happen during
        a panic attack. Examples include: “I will faint,” “It will go on forever,” “I’ll embarrass
        myself,” “I’ll have a heart attack,” or “I’ll die.” To become more aware of your specific
        fears, try to identify your thoughts (and write them down) whenever you feel anxious or
        feel an urge to avoid or escape a situation.
    </p>

    
    <h3>There are two categories of thoughts that might occur during panic attack:</h3>
    <p>1. Overestimating: This happens when we believe that something that is highly
        unlikely is about to happen; for example, when we believe that we will faint or die as a
        result of a panic attack. This type of thinking is usually related to physical fears (such as
        fainting and hurting oneself, having a heart attack, going crazy, or dying)</p>
    <p>2. Catastrophizing: This is when we imagine the worst possible thing is about to
        happen and that we will not be able to cope. For example: “I’ll embarrass myself and
        everyone will laugh” or “I’ll freak out and no one will help.” This type of thinking is often
        related to social concerns (such as embarrassing oneself).</p>

    <h3>Challenging Overestimating</h3>
    <p>First, it is important to realize that your thoughts are
        guesses about what will happen, not actual facts. Next, evaluate the evidence for or
        against your thoughts. Individuals with panic disorder often confuse a possibility with a
        probability (for example, just because it can happen, doesn’t mean that it likely will). </p>
    
    <p>Here are some questions to ask yourself:
        1. How many times have I had this thought during a panic attack?
        2. How many times has it actually happened?
        3. Next time I have this thought, how likely is it that it will really happen?
        It is helpful to realize that some of the things you fear are VERY unlikely to occur. Even
        though you have had this thought many times, it has not come true. 
    </p>

    <h3>Challenging Catastrophizing</h3>
    <p>To challenge catastrophic thinking, ask yourself to imagine the worst and then figure out how you would cope. 
        Here are some questions to ask yourself:
        1. What’s the worst that can happen?
        2. How bad is it REALLY?
        3. Is it a hassle or a horror?
        4. Will it make a difference in my life in a week or year from now?
        5. What could I do to cope if it did happen?
        6. Have I been embarrassed in the past? How did it turn out? Did it make a
        difference?
        It is important to understand that some of the things you fear are more of a hassle than a
        horror, and that there are things you can do to cope with the situation. </p>

    <h2>Affirmations</h2>
    <p>
        It can be tough to remember how to challenge scary thoughts when we are
        anxious. It can help to make up a “coping card” that includes realistic thoughts about
        panic attacks (e.g., “It’s a hassle, not a horror,” “It won’t last for forever”) that you can
        carry with you during the day to help manage anxiety. To make a “coping card,” use an
        index card or a piece of paper, write down your realistic thoughts, and keep it with you
        (i.e., in your purse, wallet, or pocket). It can be helpful to read this card daily, just as a
        reminder!

    <h2>Facing your fears</h2>
    <p>
        Individuals with panic disorder are typically sensitive
        to physical sensations (for example, increased heart rate, dizziness, blurred vision,
        chest pain). In order to overcome panic, you need to repeatedly bring on the
        sensations you fear so that over time those sensations no longer make you
        anxious. This also gives you a chance to see that your fears do not come true (for
        example, you don’t pass out or die).
